# Revolver + Client-Side Photo Upload on iOS 6 Safari 6 

A 360Â° panorama photo viewer. Also uploads a photo client-side.

## Issues

Photo uploads locally but doesn't revolve. You will see the Div and Images get loaded in through Javascript.

The Revolver.js file turns your image source into two and also gives those two images the correct classes names. The index page has some js on it where you'll notice those two img tags and their classes are hard coded in.

My guess is there is a different way to write this to get the local files Revolving!
